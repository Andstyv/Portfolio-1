            <li>Navigation bar max width</li>
            <li>Opening hours display</li>

          </ul>
          <h3>How I changed it</h3>
          <p>
            <p>The infinitely wide navigation bar was fixed by adding a max width to it.</p> <p>
              To change the opening hours based on what day of the week it is, a JS function that shows the day of the week as a
              number from 1-7, connects its results against an array containing the opening hours for each day.
            </p> <p>
              The current hamburger menu in the navigation was discarded, and replaced by a new one
              built from scratch with JS. The new one contains a set of elements that is shown or hidden on click, by using an event listener in JS.
            </p> <p>
              Originally, the site had two different navigation
              bars that would be displayed according to the screen size of the viewer. Instead of this, I created a new flexible navigation bar that suits all screen sizes by changing its appearance
              based on the screen size. This was done utilizing flex-box and media queries.
            </p> <p>
              Many of the site's elements had a second class added to them to minimize the number of lines of code needed to
              style them.
            </p> <p>
              At the site's contact page, a form validation was created with JS. This validation checks the value of the inputs up against some predefined rules, and only activates the
              "Send" button for the user if all conditions are met.
            </p> <p>
              A portion of the site's appearance was also redone by changing the red colour used on different objects to a lighter and more neutral
              one. Lastly, the footer section of the site was redone by changing it from a three column flexbox to a two plus two grid that better suited all screen sizes.
            </p>
          </p>
          <h3>Why I did it that way</h3>
          <p><p>
            One of the first things I noticed when opening the website, was that the navigation bar would stretch infinitely accross the width of the screen. This happened due to a lack of max-width
            styling, which was added. This was done to optimize the site's readability and responsiveness in large screen sizes.</p> <p>The new function for showing opening hours of the museum was added to
            create a more dynamic website that would show actual relevant information, rather than just hardcoded text. As a result of this, the opening hours could also easily be changed in the
            array, and displayed on the site immidiately.</p><p> Further on, the hamburger menu was redone because of the need for a more flexible and functional one, in contrast to the old hardcoded one.</p><p>
            One of the main reasons for changing from two different navigation bars to a single flexible one was the site's accessability. One could imagine that an assistive program like a screen
            reader could interpret some difficult to understand information with the site having two navigations rather than just one, as it should have. This would also reduce the amount of both code
            and styling needed to style two navigation bars. </p><p>Another change that was done to reduce the amount of code in the project was adding a second class to many of the repeatable elements that
            would be styled almost exactly the same. By adding a second class, one of the classes would function as a main class and contain most of the styling, while the element specific styling
            would be done in the other class.</p><p> An additional styling feature that was changed was the colour of some of the elements of the page. These elements were originally coloured in a bright
            red/pink colour, that ultimately was changed to a more subtle and neutral tone, as the original colour demanded a little too much attention from the user's eyes. </p><p>At last, the main reason
            for redoing the footer completely was the lack of flexibility accross all screen sizes. At low screen sizes, the footer would squeeze all its elements very tightly together and decrease
            the readability while increasing the chance of a user missclick. Therefore, the now footer was designed to utilize more space in the height dimension rather than being too wide.</p>

          <h3>What was changed</h3>
          <ul class="main-ul">
            <li>The shopping cart now stores items accross all of the site's pages</li>
            <li>Check to see if local storage already contains items before adding new ones to cart</li>
            <li>Two static navigation bars reduced to one flexible</li>
            <li>Added product categories</li>
            <li>Ability to search for specific products</li>
            <li>Reduced file size and loading times for product images</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>How I changed it</h3>
          <p>
            The shopping carts storage issues were corrected by implementing a JS function that checks if an array exists in the user's local storage in their web browser. If not, an empty array is
            created, and eventually filled up if the user adds any products to it. This was in contrast to the old shopping cart, where a new array of products would be created every time a user would
            enter a new specific product. <p>The search and filter functionalities were added by creating a function that sends a new API call with the information from the user inputted fields as
            arguments. For the category selection, each product was connected to a category in the WordPress database, so that the API call could simply use this as an argument.</p> <p>By running the product
            images through several online image optimizers (as TinyPNG), the file size could be reduced by almost 80 % compared to the original
          </p></p>
          <h3>Why I did it that way</h3>
          <p>
            <p>
              One of the main flaws of the website was that the shopping cart would not store products accross the different pages of the site. This was due to the local storage array being reset every
              time a user would choose a different product than the initial one to add to the cart.
            </p> <p>
              A function was created that runs every time a new product site is visited, and if a previous storage
              array exists, new products would be added to this one, rather than creating a empty new one. If it's the first visit for a user, an empty array would be created and eventually filled if
              the user adds an item to their cart.
            </p> <p>
              To further optimize the user-friendliness of the site, options to filter the site's products were created. Along with this, searching functionaly was
              also implemented. to make the website more dynamic and scalable.
            </p> <p>
              I chose to assign the different products to categories in the WordPress database to make it simpler to update, change or
              remove both categories and their connected products.
            </p> <p>
              The reason for putting work into reducing the file size of the product images was that with the amount of reduction that was managed,
              the site's loading speed was drastically increased, but with almost withouth compromising on image quality. A feature I think would be greatly appreciated by end users.

          <h3>What was changed</h3>
          <ul class="main-ul">
            <li>Form validation for newsletter subscription</li>
            <li>Missing labels for some input fields</li>
            <li>Corrected alt text for header image</li>
            <li>New loading animation when fetching blog posts</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>How I changed it</h3>
          <p><p>The form validation for the newsletter subscription input was created the same way as the contact form validations. </p>
            <p>A javascript functions first checks if any input exists at all, and then if the input (e-mail) corresponds with a given set of rules (must include a @ and so on). </p>
            <p>To create a connected label to the input form, the div container containing text informartion about what kind of input field it is was simply changed to a label element that is then wrapped around the input field.</p>
            <p>The about image alt text was changed to a more informative and descriptive one. A new loading animations spinner was added by creating a circular div element with a part of its border being another colour than the rest. By using CSS animation properties this border was then animated to spin around until the content has finished loading, which then removes the loader.</p></p>
          <h3>Why I did it that way</h3>
          <p>
            <p>The form validation was added to give the user feedback when trying to submit a non-valid e-mail address, or when trying to submit withouth inputting anything. This, together with the success message that appears if the e-mail is successfully sent, gives the user a confirmation of wether or not their request has been submitted.</p>
            <p>Both the added labels for the newsletter input field and the new alt text for the header image in the "about" section were added to improve the site's accessability for every user, and especially for those who use assistive technologies as screen readers or similarly.</p>
            <p>The new loading animation that appears when the API call goes out and items are fetched was made to supply the user of the page with some feedback of wether something is actually happening in the background when they click the "blog" section of the site or not. By adding this loader, the site indicates to their user that their request is being handled, and that they can expect an output shortly.</p>
